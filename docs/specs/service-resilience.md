# Service Resilience Specification

Version: 1.0  
Last Updated: September 21, 2025

## Overview

This document specifies essential service resilience patterns for the OET Praxis platform's microservices architecture. These patterns ensure service stability without overcomplicating the system.

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

1. Third-Party Service Calls
   - Timeout: 5 seconds
   - Error Threshold: 50% of requests
   - Reset Time: 30 seconds
   - Apply to: LiveKit, Stripe, Hugging Face API calls

2. Inter-service Communication
   - Timeout: 2 seconds
   - Error Threshold: 50% of requests
   - Reset Time: 15 seconds
   - Apply to: All internal service-to-service calls

## Fallback Behaviors

1. LiveKit Disruption
   - Immediately notify user of connection issues
   - Allow session restart from last checkpoint
   - Cache last 30 seconds of audio locally

2. Payment Processing
   - Queue failed webhook events for retry
   - Maximum 3 retries with exponential backoff
   - Alert admin on persistent failures

3. AI Services
   - Cache most recent model responses
   - Use simplified backup response templates
   - Maximum response wait time: 5 seconds

## Retry Policies

1. Database Operations
   - Maximum 3 retries
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
   - Apply to: Write operations only

2. External API Calls
   - Maximum 2 retries
   - Linear backoff: 1s
   - Apply to: Idempotent operations only

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing resilience libraries (no custom implementation)
- Log all circuit breaker events
- Monitor failure rates in existing metrics
- Use default timeout configurations
