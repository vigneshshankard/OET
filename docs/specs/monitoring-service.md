# Monitoring Service Specification

Version: 1.0  
Last Updated: September 21, 2025

## Overview

This document specifies the monitoring requirements for the OET Praxis platform, defining metrics, alerts, and monitoring interfaces based on the system architecture and performance requirements.

## 1. Service Health Metrics

### 1.1 Basic Health Metrics
```json
{
  "service_health": {
    "uptime_seconds": "number",
    "memory_usage_mb": "number",
    "cpu_usage_percent": "number",
    "active_connections": "number"
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Service-Specific Metrics
Based on performance targets from system-architecture.md:

| Service | Metric | Threshold |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| API Gateway | Request Latency | < 100ms |
| Session Service | Audio Processing | < 100ms |
| LLM Service | Response Time | < 2s |
| Database | Query Time | < 100ms |

## 2. Alert Definitions

### 2.1 Service Alerts
```json
{
  "alert": {
    "service": "string",
    "severity": "high|medium|low",
    "condition": "string",
    "threshold": "number",
    "current_value": "number",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Alert Thresholds
Based on system-architecture.md requirements:
- Error Rate: > 1% of requests
- Response Time: > 2x normal
- CPU Usage: > 80%
- Memory Usage: > 85%
- Disk Usage: > 80%

## 3. Metrics Collection

### 3.1 Collection Intervals
- Basic Health: 30 seconds
- Performance Metrics: 1 minute
- Business Metrics: 5 minutes
- Detailed Traces: On demand

### 3.2 Storage Duration
- Raw Metrics: 7 days
- Aggregated Metrics: 90 days
- Alert History: 30 days

## 4. Health Checks

### 4.1 Service Health Endpoints
Required for each service as per system-architecture.md:
```http
GET /health
Response:
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "details": {
    "database": "up|down",
    "cache": "up|down",
    "dependencies": ["service1", "service2"]
  }
}
```

## 5. Implementation Notes

1. Use standard monitoring libraries
2. Implement health checks first
3. Add metrics collection
4. Configure alerts last
5. No custom monitoring solutions

## 6. Limitations

- No APM tracing (not specified in requirements)
- No custom dashboards (use standard views)
- No predictive analytics
- No automated remediation
