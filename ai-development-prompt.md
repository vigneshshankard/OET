```

### Component Usage Rules
```typescript
// ONLY use components specified in ui-design-system.md
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"
// etc. - EXACT component names from specification

// FORBIDDEN - Do not create custom components not in spec
‚ùå import { CustomButton } from "@/components/custom-button"
‚ùå import { MyCard } from "@/components/my-card"
```

### API Integration Rules
```typescript
// ONLY use endpoints documented in api-specification.md
const endpoints = {
  // Example from specification
  "POST /api/auth/login": { /* exact payload structure */ },
  "GET /api/scenarios": { /* exact response structure */ },
  // etc.
}

// FORBIDDEN - Do not create undocumented endpoints
‚ùå "POST /api/custom-endpoint"
‚ùå "GET /api/my-feature"
```

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before implementing ANY feature, verify:

### ‚úÖ PRE-DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST
- [ ] Feature exists in specification files
- [ ] Exact component names from ui-design-system.md
- [ ] API endpoints documented in api-specification.md
- [ ] User flow matches user-journeys.md
- [ ] Data structure matches database-schema.md
- [ ] Error handling follows error-handling.md
- [ ] Content follows content-guidelines.md

### ‚úÖ DURING DEVELOPMENT
- [ ] No custom components beyond specifications
- [ ] No additional API endpoints
- [ ] No modified user flows
- [ ] Using exact mock data from mock-data-specification.md
- [ ] Following exact styling from ui-design-system.md

### ‚úÖ POST-DEVELOPMENT
- [ ] All features match specifications exactly
- [ ] No additional functionality added
- [ ] No technology stack deviations
- [ ] All content follows professional healthcare tone

## üö® WHEN TO STOP AND ASK

### IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION REQUIRED FOR:
1. **Missing API Details**: "The specification mentions user authentication but doesn't specify the exact JWT payload structure"
2. **Ambiguous UI Behavior**: "The user-journeys.md mentions 'session feedback' but doesn't specify the exact interaction pattern"
3. **Conflicting Information**: "system-architecture.md mentions Redis but database-schema.md doesn't include Redis schemas"
4. **Undefined Components**: "The wireframe shows a 'ProgressChart' but ui-design-system.md doesn't specify this component"
5. **Missing Business Logic**: "How should the system handle subscription expiry during an active session?"

### EXAMPLE CLARIFICATION REQUESTS:
```
"I need clarification on [specific requirement]. The specification files show:
- File A says: [exact quote]
- File B says: [exact quote]
- Missing detail: [specific missing information]

Please provide the exact implementation details or point me to the correct specification section."
```

## üí° APPROVED REFERENCE SOURCES

### PRIMARY SOURCE (99% of decisions)

4. Ask for clarification if needed

### Step 2: Implementation Planning
1. Confirm component usage from ui-design-system.md
2. Confirm API endpoints from api-specification.md
3. Confirm user flow from user-journeys.md
4. Confirm data structure from database-schema.md

### Step 3: Development
1. Implement exactly as specified
2. Use exact mock data from mock-data-specification.md
3. Follow exact content from content-guidelines.md
4. Test against specification requirements

### Step 4: Validation

## FINAL REMINDER

You are building a production healthcare platform for medical professionals. Every detail matters for credibility and user trust. When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than make assumptions. The specifications are comprehensive and complete - trust them and follow them exactly.

**Remember: Better to ask for clarification than to implement incorrectly.**
